    python setup.py sdist

    twine upload --repository-url ${PYPI_URL} --username ${PYPI_USER} --password ${PYPI_PASSWORD} dist/* 

## Release to Maven Central

Pre-requisites:

- pgp installed 
- a default pgp key generated in registered in a public registry ( e.g. keys.openpgp.org)

    export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
